# > RedOS Description And Introduction
## What Is RedOS?
RedOS is a modifiable and open source Mock-OS created using python. I created this to help me learn the language more and allow me to confine myself to more advanced operations, even though python may be the easiest coding language to learn.

## What Dependencies or Packages does RedOS Use?
RedOS required Pytube, Colorama, and the Faker Packages to run all applications properly.
> Pytube allows for youtube videos to be downloaded just using a link, this package is included because i was at a loss of other things to add.

>
>Colorama allows for certain text to be given color, added so it can add some more feel, organization, and simplicity to RedOS.

>
>Faker allows certain information such as a name, address, date, and more to be randomly generated on command.

None of these applications ever have malicious intent, and none of them will cause intended harm to your host device. Although, if included, some of the packages (like a ddos api) are capable of harmful actions and should only be used for educational or testing purposes if implemented by you. I am not liable for any malicious content or actions created by consumers.

## What Can I Modify and Change in RedOS?
RedOS can be easily configurable by changing the variables and classes inside of the "assets/system/config.py" located inside of the RedOS root directory. Many variables include the OS name, the OS version, built-in application names and versions, all organized in an easy to read manner. More information for developers will be released on this when this project gets more expansive.
